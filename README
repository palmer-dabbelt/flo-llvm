flo-llvm: Converts Flo files to LLVM IR

This provides an efficient mechanism for executing dataflow graphs
that are represented as Flo files.  Ideally it will eventually
eliminate Chisel's C++ backend, as well as provide a basis for LLVM
backends that target other architectures (DREAMER, for example).
